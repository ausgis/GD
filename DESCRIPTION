Description: Geographical detectors for measuring spatial stratified heterogeneity,
             as described in Jinfeng Wang (2010) <doi:10.1080/13658810802443457> and 
             Jinfeng Wang (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.02.052>. Includes the
             optimal discretization of continuous data, four primary functions of 
             geographical detectors, comparison of size effects of spatial unit and 
             the visualizations of results. To use the package and to refer the 
             descriptions of the package, methods and case datasets, please cite 
             Yongze Song (2020) <doi:10.1080/15481603.2020.1760434>. The model has 
             been applied in factor exploration of road performance and multi-scale 
             spatial segmentation for network data, as described in 
             Yongze Song (2018) <doi:10.3390/rs10111696> and 
             Yongze Song (2020) <doi:10.1109/TITS.2020.3001193>, respectively.
